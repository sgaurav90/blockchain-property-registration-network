Problems/Challenges of Property Registration
The whole process can be inefficient due to the chance of fault by trusted third parties run by humans.
There could be multiple parties claiming ownership of the same property.
Although property ownership can be challenged in court, the verification process is cumbersome and time-consuming.
Ownership documents could be tampered with.
Tampering with land deeds can lead to the wrong individuals acquiring ownership of a property for personal gain. This is a major issue in developing countries, and it also creates a huge backlog of civil cases in courts.
Benami registrations: These are transactions in which a property is transferred to one person for the consideration paid by another. This also leads to corruption and tax evasion.
Solution using Blockchain
Blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger that is shared with everyone present on a network. Each network participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination. Moreover, the records stored on a blockchain are immutable, making it very difficult to tamper with them. This provides greater security. A solution such as Hyperledger Fabric also offers the features to maintain users and roles, which additionally help secure and identify owners.

 

Governments can utilize a blockchainâ€™s feature set to reduce the difficulties faced in the traditional property registration process. A distributed ledger can be set up among the buyer, seller, bank, registration authority, and notary. Property details can be stored on the blockchain and accessed from it, and these details remain immutable, meaning nobody can alter them.
