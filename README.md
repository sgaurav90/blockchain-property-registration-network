# Property Registration System Using Blockchain

## Overview
Property registration is a crucial process that ensures the legal ownership of land and property. However, the traditional process is plagued by inefficiencies, fraud, and legal challenges. This project leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient property registration system, addressing the challenges inherent in conventional methods.

## Problems/Challenges in Traditional Property Registration
- **Inefficiency:** The process can be inefficient due to human error or deliberate misconduct by trusted third parties.
- **Ownership Disputes:** Multiple parties may claim ownership of the same property, leading to legal disputes.
- **Cumbersome Verification:** Verifying ownership through the courts is time-consuming and often complex.
- **Document Tampering:** Ownership documents can be tampered with, leading to fraud.
- **Wrongful Ownership:** Tampering with land deeds can result in the wrong individuals acquiring property ownership, particularly in developing countries, contributing to civil case backlogs in courts.
- **Benami Registrations:** These involve transactions where the property is registered in one personâ€™s name but is actually owned by another, leading to corruption and tax evasion.

## Solution Using Blockchain
Blockchain technology offers a robust solution to these challenges by providing an immutable distributed ledger that is shared among all participants in the network. Each participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination, ensuring secure and transparent transactions.

### Key Benefits:
- **Immutability:** Records stored on the blockchain cannot be altered, providing greater security and reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are visible to the participants, ensuring transparency in property dealings.
- **Efficiency:** The use of smart contracts can automate and expedite the property registration process.
- **Role-based Access:** Solutions like Hyperledger Fabric allow for maintaining users and roles, which helps in securing and identifying owners and other stakeholders.

### How It Works:
1. **Distributed Ledger:** A blockchain ledger is maintained among the buyer, seller, bank, registration authority, and notary.
2. **Immutable Records:** Property details and transaction records are stored on the blockchain, making them immutable and tamper-proof.
3. **Smart Contracts:** Automated contracts execute transactions when predefined conditions are met, ensuring efficiency and reducing human error.
4. **Role-based Access Control:** Access to the blockchain is controlled based on the roles of the participants, ensuring security and privacy.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain Framework:** Hyperledger Fabric
- **Smart Contracts:** Chaincode written in Go/JavaScript
- **Web Application:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** LevelDB/CouchDB (as per Hyperledger Fabric configuration)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Testing Tools:** Postman (for API testing)
